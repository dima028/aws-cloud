# Module 6: Security
## Shared Responsibility Model
**Shared Responsibility Model:** Treat the environment as a collection of parts that build upon each other. In this model, the responsibility of the security of certain components belongs 100% to one entity (i.e. Amazon) while the responsibility to security of other components belongs 100% to another (i.e. the customer).
* AWS: Security of the Cloud, responsible for creating a secure architecture at all layers including: host operating system, virtualization layer, and the physical security of the data centers from which services operate. 
* The Customer: Security in the Cloud, responsible for implementing security best practises in everything they create and put into the AWS cloud.
** This can leveraging AWS's own services such as configuring security groups and managing user accounts.
