# Module 6: Security
## Shared Responsibility Model
**Shared Responsibility Model:** the model in which the responsibility of the security of certain components belongs 100% to one entity (i.e. Amazon) while the responsibility to security of other components belongs 100% to another (i.e. the customer). Treat the environment as a collection of parts that build upon each other. The shared responsibility model divides into customer responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security in the cloud”) and AWS responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security of the cloud”).
* AWS is responsible for constructing your house and ensuring that it is solidly built. 
* The customer isresponsible for securing everything in the house and ensuring that the doors are closed and locked.
