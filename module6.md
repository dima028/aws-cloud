# Module 6: Security
## Shared Responsibility Model
**Shared Responsibility Model:** Treat the environment as a collection of parts that build upon each other. In this model, the responsibility of the security of certain components belongs 100% to one entity (i.e. Amazon) while the responsibility to security of other components belongs 100% to another (i.e. the customer).
* AWS: Security of the Cloud, responsible for creating a secure architecture. 
* The Customer: Security in the Cloud, responsible for implementing security best practises within this architecture.
