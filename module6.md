# Module 6: Security
## Shared Responsibility Model
**Shared Responsibility Model:** Treat the environment as a collection of parts that build upon each other. In this model, the responsibility of the security of certain components belongs 100% to one entity (i.e. Amazon) while the responsibility to security of other components belongs 100% to another (i.e. the customer).
* AWS: Security of the Cloud, responsible for creating a secure architecture at all layers including: host operating system, virtualization layer, and the physical security of the data centers from which services operate. 
* The Customer: Security in the Cloud, responsible for implementing security best practises in everything they create and put into the AWS cloud.
** This can leveraging AWS's own services such as configuring security groups and managing user accounts. 

## User Permissions and Access
**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Gives you the flexibility to configure access based on your companyâ€™s specific operational and security needs, by using a combination of IAM features such as:
  * IAM users, groups, and roles, 
  * IAM policies, 
  * Multi-factor authentication,

**Account Management Best Practises:**
* AWS Account Root User: has complete access to all the AWS services and resources in the account.
  *  **Do not** use the root user for everyday tasks.
  *  **Do** use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.
  *  **Do** continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS. Only use root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user (i.e. changing root user email address, changing AWS support plan).
